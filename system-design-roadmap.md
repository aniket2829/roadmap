- Design a global payment system
- Design a search engine
- Design a distributed file system

### Week 25-26: Mock Interviews and Refinement
- Practice whiteboarding sessions
- Time-boxed design exercises (45-60 minutes)
- Peer review and feedback
- Refine communication and presentation skills

## Key Principles to Remember

### Design Process
1. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements (scale, performance)
   - Constraints and assumptions

2. **Estimate Scale**
   - Users, data size, requests per second
   - Read/write ratios
   - Storage requirements

3. **High-Level Design**
   - Major components
   - Data flow
   - API design

4. **Detailed Design**
   - Database schema
   - Algorithms and data structures
   - Specific technologies

5. **Scale the Design**
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Propose solutions
   - Trade-off analysis

### Communication Tips
- Think out loud during design sessions
- Ask clarifying questions
- Explain trade-offs and reasoning
- Start simple and iterate
- Be prepared to defend your choices

## Success Metrics

### By Phase 2 Completion
- Able to design basic systems with proper component separation
- Understanding of when to use different database types
- Knowledge of caching strategies and their trade-offs

### By Phase 3 Completion
- Comfortable with microservices architecture
- Understanding of distributed systems challenges
- Knowledge of security and reliability patterns

### By Phase 4 Completion
- Able to design complex systems end-to-end

## Weekly Time Commitment

- **Study Time:** 10-15 hours per week
- **Practice Problems:** 3-5 hours per week
- **Reading:** 2-3 hours per week
- **Hands-on Projects:** 5-8 hours per week (optional but recommended)

Remember that system design is learned through practice and iteration. Focus on understanding principles rather than memorizing solutions, and always consider trade-offs in your designs.
